# repeatedSpeckleInspector
Run the Fiji or ImageJ speckle inspector repeatedly with the same settings for many different binary image pairs.

At the very bottom, line 225, you will see example variables to replace with yours. You can record a macro in Fiji
that will track your manual execution of the speckle inspector. Look at the format string in the macro after you run it.
It looks something like "primary=[yourFileName.TIF]..." you can replace lines 203-206 with that but replace the 
file names with brackets '{}'. to change your settings. Or message me and I may help!
