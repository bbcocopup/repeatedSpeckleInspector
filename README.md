# repeatedSpeckleInspector
Run the Fiji or ImageJ speckle inspector repeatedly with the same settings for many different binary image pairs.

1) Save this .py file in your Fiji.app/scripts folder for it to work.

2) At the very bottom, you will see example inputs to replace with yours inside a "main()" function.

Note) You can record a macro in Fiji that will track your manual execution of the speckle inspector. Look at the format string in the macro after you run it.
It looks something like "primary=[yourFileName.TIF]..." you can replace lines 203-206 with that but replace the 
file names with brackets '{}'. to change your settings. Or message me and I may help!
